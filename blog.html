It runs on most operating systems, including Linux, MacOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and Windows. It also includes agentless monitoring for use with for example Cisco or Juniper hardware. This tutorial covers the installation of the OSSEC server, the standard OSSEC Web UI and the Analogi dashboard on Ubuntu 12.04. It also covers OSSEC setup with MySQL support, including a Makefile bugfix. Last but not least it shows you how to install the OSSEC agent on a *NIX system.</p><a href="static/<open file 's/blog.html', mode 'w' at 0x10cf2b390>.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h3 class="blogh3"><a href="static/<open file 's/blog.html', mode 'w' at 0x10cf2b390>.html">OS X - Enable access for assitive devices via the command line</a></h3><small class="pull-left">Date: 03-09-2013</small><small class="pull-right">Author: Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This command enables access for assistive devices on Apple OS X machines via the command line.

Why? Because this is the decimal form of the binary IP address. Normally we represent IP addresses as 10.0.0.1, 4 blocks of numbers. Those numbers are actually binary octets represented in decimal, therefore they can never be more than 255. If we take the whole binary number of all blocks, and convert that to base 10, we get a result like above, which in turn is a working network address. I've written a little javascript based converter so you can try it out yourself.</p><a href="static/<open file 's/blog.html', mode 'w' at 0x10cf2b390>.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h3 class="blogh3"><a href="static/<open file 's/blog.html', mode 'w' at 0x10cf2b390>.html">Set up your own truly secure, encrypted and shared file synchronization, aka Dropbox clone</a></h3><small class="pull-left">Date: 31-08-2013</small><small class="pull-right">Author: Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This article describes my truly secure, encrypted file synchronization service.

They all offer kind of the same thing, a place for you to store your files. Main differences are the storage space you get and collaborative/syncing features. And, a lot of providers say they are secure, but they do not have 'Trust No One' encryption (which means, you have the key to your data and only you can access it. If you loose the key or password, you're out of luck.) Those companies, like dropbox or google drive at the time of writing, all state that in their terms of service, and/or you are not able to check the source code to verify they can or cannot access your data. What we are going to do to prevent this? Very simple, provide our own pre-internet encryption with truecrypt.</p><a href="static/<open file 's/blog.html', mode 'w' at 0x10cf2b390>.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h3 class="blogh3"><a href="static/<open file 's/blog.html', mode 'w' at 0x10cf2b390>.html">Bash - do something in every subdirectory</a></h3><small class="pull-left">Date: 16-05-2012</small><small class="pull-right">Author: Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>Snippet which has a copy paste bash for loop to do something in a directory.</p><a href="static/<open file 's/blog.html', mode 'w' at 0x10cf2b390>.html">Read more...</a><br /><p></p><h3 class="blogh3"><a href="static/<open file 's/blog.html', mode 'w' at 0x10cf2b390>.html">Bash script to list all changed files in certain peroid</a></h3><small class="pull-left">Date: 13-05-2012</small><small class="pull-right">Author: Remy van Elst</small><br /><p>This is a little script I wrote and use to get a daily report of all the files that have changed on my servers.
