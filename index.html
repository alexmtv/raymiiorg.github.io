To save space and reduce the amount of files I decided to create archives with tar. The files will be stored to tapes and DVD's, and will be restored in full, so random access times are not an issue, therefore the tar.gz choice. I do want to make sure that when the files need to be restored they still are correct. I first dabbled with some long shell commands to create checksums and verify them, but then I found the `rhash` tool in the repositories. It allows you to create checksums of files and folders, recursively, with all sorts of checksums, like CRC, MD5, SHA1 and many more. It also makes bulk validation very simple. This small article shows you how to create an archive file with the checksums included and shows you how to validate these checksums later on.</p><a href="blog/Generate_hashes_of_files_with_rhash_for_archival_storage.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Lets_Encrypt_Directadmin.html">Let's Encrypt with DirectAdmin or other Web Control Panels</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">10-12-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>Let's Encrypt is a new certificate authority, recognized by all major browsers.

Let's Encrypt provides free, automatic and secure certificates so that every website can be secured with an SSL certificate. This article shows you how to setup Let's Encrypt with the DirectAdmin web control panel. The guide is generic, so it works for other controlpanels as well.

The setup is mounted on a flatscreen TV and uses a small Wifi dongle for network access and a small Bluetooth dongle for a Rapoo E6700 wireless bluetooth keyboard/touchpad. This is a nice bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo for a media center, it charges via micro USB. That saves a lot of battery hassle. The bluetooth adapter is a Sitecom CN-524, which was the only one my local electronic store had available. It however does not work with linux/Kodi by default. This is because the device boots in a wrong mode.

Nagios is an open source computer system monitoring, network monitoring and infrastructure monitoring software application. Nagios offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications, and services. It alerts the users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when the problem has been resolved. The version in the Ubuntu 12.04 repositories is quite old, it is still the in the 3 branch. This guide helps to fix that by using the latest Nagios version. We also install Nagiosgraph, a plugin for Nagios which gives you graps of the metrics.</p><a href="tutorials/Nagios_Core_4_Installation_on_Ubuntu_12.04.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/LG_Chromebase_Linux.html">Install Ubuntu Linux on the LG Chromebase</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">03-08-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>I recently acquired the LG Chromebase 22CV241-W.

Of course I removed Chrome OS and installed a real Linux on it, of which you'll find instructions below. In my case it is Ubuntu Mate. Arch Linux also works fine, but this was for someone else, so a more beginner friendly distro seemed to be a better choise.

I'll also cover a few basic commands like the editor, user management and system information. TSS-8 was a little time-sharing operating system released in 1968 and requires a minimum of 12K words of memory and a swapping device; on a 24K word machine, it supports up to 17 users. Each user gets a virtual 4K PDP-8; many of the utilities users ran on these virtual machines were only slightly modified versions of utilities from the Disk Monitor System or paper-tape environments. Internally, TSS-8 consists of RMON, the resident monitor, DMON, the disk monitor (file system), and KMON, the keyboard monitor (command shell). BASIC was well supported, while restricted (4K) versions of FORTRAN D and Algol were available.</p><a href="articles/Running_TSS_8_on_the_DEC_PiDP-8_i_and_SIMH.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Running_ADVENT-on-the-PDP-8-with-SIMH.html">Running Adventure on the DEC PDP-8 with SIMH</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">23-07-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>In this guide I'll show you how run the classic Colossal Cave Adventure game on a PDP-8, emulated by the SIMH emulator.

We will use FORTRAN on OS/8 to load ADVENTURE, then we use our brain to play the game.
