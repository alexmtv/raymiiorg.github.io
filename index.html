I've worked as a sysadmin (devops) for Certificate Authorities, Hospitals, Managed Service providers, Datacenters Development shops and large Internet Service providers. I currently work for an Openstack provider. I like to design, build and manage large, complex and high available systems. I like to work with configuration management tools and version control systems. Documentation, monitoring and backups are things I do first, not when the time allows it later.<br/>This is my personal website, please do note that these articles do not reflect opinions or policies of any of my (previous) employers, only my personal one.</p><hr/><h2>Latest Items</h2><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Raspberry_Pi_FM_Radio_With_Buttons.html">Raspberry Pi FM radio transmitter with Buttons</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">03-04-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>The PiFM project allows you to use a Raspberry Pi to send out a WAV file on the FM band. This is awesome because every normal radio then can receive your music/podcast without expensive (sonos) equipment. I've used a lasercutter to craft a new top plate for my Pi which has room for three buttons. These are hooked up to a python script which allows me to start and stop the transmission, and skip or go back songs. It also allows me to shut down the Pi instead of just pulling the power cable.</p><a href="articles/Raspberry_Pi_FM_Radio_With_Buttons.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Olimex_A20-OLinuXino-LIME2_minimal_debian_7_image.html">Olimex OlinuXino A20 LIME2 Minimal Debian 7 Image</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">28-01-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>The Olimex OlinuXino A20 LIME2 is an amazing, powerfull and cheap open source ARM development board. It costs EUR 45, and has 160 GPIO pins. The default Debian image from OlimeX is quite huge and bloated, over 2,5 GB, with X and all. I do not want a huge image, so I stripped it down to a 200 MB image with only dhcp and ssh and a few basic tools. It uses about 15 MB of RAM. This image allows you to start with almost nothing and build up only what you need.</p><a href="articles/Olimex_A20-OLinuXino-LIME2_minimal_debian_7_image.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="software/OpenVZ_Proxmox_-_pre-backup_all_container_dump_script.html">OpenVZ/Proxmox - pre-backup all container dump script</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">18-01-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>This simple script creates a vzdump of all the OpenVZ containers on a machine. It can be used before an actual backup, in my case the actual backup excludes the container path /var/lib/vz/private.

Most of them don't offer filtering capabilites like Sieve, or only their own non exportable rule system (Google Apps). My mail client of choice, Thunderbird, has filtering capabilities but my phone has not and I don't want to leave my machine running Thunderbird all the time since it gets quite slow with huge mailboxes. Imapfilter is a mail filtering utility written in Lua which connects to one or more IMAP accounts and filters on the server using IMAP queries. It is a lightweight command line utility, the configuration can be versioned and is simple text and it is very fast.</p><a href="blog/Filtering_IMAP_mail_with_imapfilter.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="blog/Broken_Corrupted_Raspberry_Pi_SD_Card.html">Broken Corrupted Raspberry Pi SD Card</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">09-01-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>One of my Raspberry Pi's would not boot up after a reboot. The SD card was corrupted, sadly beyond repair. This article walks you through the steps I took to try to fix the SD card, including fsck, badblocks and other filesystem utilities.

Only ssh, not gitolite or any other software. This is usefull if you have a small team of people that don't often need access to the repo and don't want something like github or bitbucket.

Since they have no IPv6 (yet) I figured the simplest way was to block access to the entire IP range. This won't work for all the CDN networks they use, but it does get you started. To find all the ranges beloning to an AS number you can query the whois.radb.net server with the AS number.</p><a href="snippets/Get_all_IP_ranges_from_an_AS_number.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="snippets/pfSense_allow_web_interface_access_on_WAN_from_specific_IP.html">pfSense allow web interface access on WAN from specific IP</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">31-12-2014 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>pfSense is a fast and simple FreeBSD based firewall appliance with a nice web managent interface and the power of the pf firewall underneath. Normally the web interface is only accessible from the management LAN (or LAN by default) interface. If you for whatever reason locked yourself out or need access from a different IP via the WAN interface you can use the easyrule command line to temporarly add a rule that allows your remote IP in.

It has a detailed explanation with every step. We choose the IPSECP protocol stack because of recent vulnerabilities found in pptpd VPNs and because it is supported on all recent operating systems by default. More than ever, your freedom and privacy when online is under threat. Governments and ISPs want to control what you can and can't see while keeping a record of everything you do, and even the shady-looking guy lurking around your coffee shop or the airport gate can grab your bank details easier than you may think.

Sometimes however, the PKGBUILD is outdated. You then need to manually fix it, by changing the download link or version.

If you for example have a command you need to run to generate a certificate (or Diffie Hellman parameters for nginx) you only want to do that once. The command itself is not convergent so it will run with every ansible run. However, the command creates a file and Ansible is able to check if that file exists. If the file exists, it will not execute the action. The same goes for checking if a file does exist and only executing the action if it exists. (The action you want to do will remove that file).</p><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Only_if_a_file_exists_or_does_not_exist.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Fix_inconsistent_Openstack_volumes_and_instances_from_Cinder_and_Nova_via_the_database.html">Fix inconsistent Openstack volumes and instances from Cinder and Nova via the database</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">22-12-2014 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>When running Openstack, sometimes the state of a volume or an instance can be inconsistent on the cluster. Nova might find a volume attached while Cinder says the volume is detached or otherwise. Sometimes a volume deletion hangs, or a detach does not work. If you've found and fixed the underlying issue (lvm, iscsi, ceph, nfs etc...) you need to bring the database up to date with the new consistent state. Most of the time a reset-state works, sometimes you need to manually edit the database to correct the state.
