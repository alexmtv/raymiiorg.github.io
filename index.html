I've worked as a sysadmin (devops) for Certificate Authorities, Hospitals, Managed Service providers, Datacenters Development shops and large Internet Service providers. I currently work for an Openstack provider. I like to design, build and manage large, complex and high available systems. I like to work with configuration management tools and version control systems.

They make it a breeze to set up TLS certificates for your web server. And for free! Let's Encrypt is supported by major players like Mozilla, Akamai, Cisco, the EFF, the Internet Security Research Group and others. Let's Encrypt provides free, automatic and secure certificates so that every website can be secured with an SSL certificate. This article shows you how to setup Let's Encrypt with the DirectAdmin web control panel. The guide is generic, so it works for other controlpanels as well. For now it works with the beta, and required some linux knowledge and root access to the hosting server.</p><a href="articles/Lets_Encrypt_Directadmin.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Linux_Containers.html">Linux Containers</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">12-11-2015 | Jonathan Robe</small><br/><p>This article goes over Linux Containers.

The setup is mounted on a flatscreen TV and uses a small Wifi dongle for network access and a small Bluetooth dongle for a Rapoo E6700 wireless bluetooth keyboard/touchpad. This is a nice bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo for a media center, it charges via micro USB. That saves a lot of battery hassle. The bluetooth adapter is a Sitecom CN-524, which was the only one my local electronic store had available. It however does not work with linux/Kodi by default. This is because the device boots in a wrong mode. This guide shows you how this can be fixed and the necessary software changes for OpenELEC.</p><a href="tutorials/Make_Openelec_Kodi_work_with_the_Sitecom_CN-524_Cambridge_Silicon_Radio_CSR_8510_A10_Bluetooth_USB_adapter_on_the_Raspberry_Pi.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Only_if_on_specific_distribution_or_distribution_version.html">Ansible - Only do action if on specific distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS or RHEL) or distribution version (ubuntu precise, ubuntu trusty)</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">24-09-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>This Ansible playbook example helps you execute actions only if you are on a certain distribution. You might have a mixed environment with CentOS and Debian and when using Ansible to execute actions on nodes you don't need to run Yum on Debian, or Apt on CentOS. Some package names are different and such, so this helps you with an only if statement to select a specific distribution. As a bonus, you also get an only_if for specific distribution versions, like Ubuntu precise (12.04 LTS) or Ubuntu trusty (14.04 LTS).</p><a href="tutorials/Ansible_-_Only_if_on_specific_distribution_or_distribution_version.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Nagios_Core_4_Installation_on_Ubuntu_12.04.html">Nagios 4 + Nagiosgraph (latest) installation on Ubuntu</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">14-09-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>This is a guide on installing the latest Nagios Core (4.1.1) on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04. Nagios is an open source computer system monitoring, network monitoring and infrastructure monitoring software application. Nagios offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications, and services. It alerts the users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when the problem has been resolved. The version in the Ubuntu 12.04 repositories is quite old, it is still the in the 3 branch. This guide helps to fix that by using the latest Nagios version. We also install Nagiosgraph, a plugin for Nagios which gives you graps of the metrics.</p><a href="tutorials/Nagios_Core_4_Installation_on_Ubuntu_12.04.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/LG_Chromebase_Linux.html">Install Ubuntu Linux on the LG Chromebase</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">03-08-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>I recently acquired the LG Chromebase 22CV241-W. It is an All in One type machine with Chrome OS. The hardware, excluding the screen and lack of battery, is largely the same as the Acer C720. Of course I removed Chrome OS and installed a real Linux on it, of which you'll find instructions below. In my case it is Ubuntu Mate. Arch Linux also works fine, but this was for someone else, so a more beginner friendly distro seemed to be a better choise. This article will cover the removal of Chrome OS and the installation of Ubuntu Mate on the LG Chromebase.</p><a href="articles/LG_Chromebase_Linux.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Running_TSS_8_on_the_DEC_PiDP-8_i_and_SIMH.html">Running TSS/8 on the DEC PiDP-8/i and SIMH</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">26-07-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>In this guide I'll show you how run the TSS/8 operating system on the PiDP replica by Oscar Vermeulen, and on SIMH on any other computer. I'll also cover a few basic commands like the editor, user management and system information. TSS-8 was a little time-sharing operating system released in 1968 and requires a minimum of 12K words of memory and a swapping device; on a 24K word machine, it supports up to 17 users. Each user gets a virtual 4K PDP-8; many of the utilities users ran on these virtual machines were only slightly modified versions of utilities from the Disk Monitor System or paper-tape environments. Internally, TSS-8 consists of RMON, the resident monitor, DMON, the disk monitor (file system), and KMON, the keyboard monitor (command shell). BASIC was well supported, while restricted (4K) versions of FORTRAN D and Algol were available.</p><a href="articles/Running_TSS_8_on_the_DEC_PiDP-8_i_and_SIMH.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Running_ADVENT-on-the-PDP-8-with-SIMH.html">Running Adventure on the DEC PDP-8 with SIMH</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">23-07-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>In this guide I'll show you how run the classic Colossal Cave Adventure game on a PDP-8, emulated by the SIMH emulator. The PDP-8 was an 12 bit minicomputer made in 1964 by DEC, the Digital Equipment Corporation. We will install and set up SIMH, the emulator with a RK05 diskimage running OS/8. We will use FORTRAN on OS/8 to load ADVENTURE, then we use our brain to play the game. As a bonus, I also show you how to edit files using EDIT, and show you a bit of the OS/8 system.</p><a href="articles/Running_ADVENT-on-the-PDP-8-with-SIMH.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="snippets/Find_all_services_using_libssl_to_restart_after_an_OpenSSL_update.html">Find all services using libssl to restart after an OpenSSL update</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">14-07-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>When you update OpenSSL, the software that currently has the ssl libraries loaded in memory do not automatically load the updated libraries. A full system reboot resolves that problem, but sometimes that is not possible. This command shows you all the software that has loaded the libraries, allowing you to restart only those services. If you don't restart or reload after an update, the software might still be vulnerable to issues that the update fixed.</p><a href="snippets/Find_all_services_using_libssl_to_restart_after_an_OpenSSL_update.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_lighttpd.html">Stong SSL Security on lighttpd</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">14-06-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>This tutorial shows you how to set up strong SSL security on the lighttpd webserver.

Openstack provides a few different ways to migrate virtual machines from one compute node to another. Each option has different requirements and restrictions, for example, you can't live-migrate without shared storage. You can't live-migrate if you have a configdrive enabled. You can't select the target host if you use the nova migrate (non-live) command etc. This article describes the most common migration scenario's including live and manual migration using native linux tools.</p><a href="articles/Openstack_-_(Manually)_migrating_(KVM)_Nova_Compute_Virtual_Machines.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/The_awesomely_epic_guide_to_KDE.html">The awesomely epic guide to KDE</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">04-05-2015 | Graham Morrison</small><br/><p>This article shows gives an overview of the major KDE features like font management, visual effects, file management, eye candy, the panels, the task switcer and more great KDE stuff.</p><a href="articles/The_awesomely_epic_guide_to_KDE.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Filing_Effective_Bug_Reports.html">Filing Effective Bug Reports</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">03-05-2015 | Ben Everard</small><br/><p>This article shows you how to report bugs properly and help open source projects by doing so.
