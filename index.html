I've worked as a sysadmin (devops) for Certificate Authorities, Hospitals, Managed Service providers, Datacenters Development shops and large Internet Service providers. I currently work for an Openstack provider. I like to design, build and manage large, complex and high available systems. I like to work with configuration management tools and version control systems.

Arch Linux is a rolling release, that means that you always have the latest and greatest software. With Arch, you're on your own. In a world where where technology is taking your personal responsibility and giving it to the cloud, or to an internet search filter or the device manufacturers, getting your hands dirty with an operating system can be a revelation. Not only will you learn a great deal about how Linux works and what holds the whole thing together, you'll get a system you understand from the inside-out, and one that can be instantly upgraded to all the latest packages. You may also learn something about yourself in the process. And despite its reputation, it's not that difficult.</p><a href="tutorials/Build_a_Flexible_and_Powerful_System_with_Arch_Linux.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Ada_Lovelace_and_The_Analytical_Engine.html">Ada Lovelace and The Analytical Engine</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">09-03-2015 | Juliet Kemp</small><br/><p>This article discusses an important piece of computing history, the Analytical Engine. It was designed by Charles Babbage. The history of Ada Lovelace is also covered, she also worked on and programmed the Analytical Engine. This article explains how the Analytical Engine works and gives us a few example programs. It also covers the calculation of the Bernoulli numbers with the Analytical Engine.</p><a href="tutorials/Ada_Lovelace_and_The_Analytical_Engine.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Solve_word_puzzles_with_bash.html">Solve word puzzles with bash</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">08-03-2015 | Ben Everard</small><br/><p>This article shows you how to solve word puzzles with Bash.

The problem that Euclid's algorithm solves is easy enough to understand: what is the largest common divisor of two integers? Take the numbers 100 and 80, for example: what's the largest number that divides into both?

By default it comes with an 3.4 kernel with binary blobs and patches from Allwinner. Recently the mainline kernel has gained support for these boards, you can now run and use the mainline kernel without these awfull non-free binary blobs.</p><a href="articles/Olimex_OlinuXino_A20_Lime2_Kernel_3.19_uBoot_Debian_7_image_building.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Raspberry_Pi_FM_Radio_With_Buttons.html">Raspberry Pi FM radio transmitter with Buttons</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">04-02-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>The PiFM project allows you to use a Raspberry Pi to send out a WAV file on the FM band. This is awesome because every normal radio then can receive your music/podcast without expensive (sonos) equipment. I've used a lasercutter to craft a new top plate for my Pi which has room for three buttons. These are hooked up to a python script which allows me to start and stop the transmission, and skip or go back songs. It also allows me to shut down the Pi instead of just pulling the power cable.</p><a href="articles/Raspberry_Pi_FM_Radio_With_Buttons.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Olimex_A20-OLinuXino-LIME2_minimal_debian_7_image.html">Olimex OlinuXino A20 LIME2 Minimal Debian 7 Image</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">28-01-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>The Olimex OlinuXino A20 LIME2 is an amazing, powerfull and cheap open source ARM development board. It costs EUR 45, and has 160 GPIO pins. The default Debian image from OlimeX is quite huge and bloated, over 2,5 GB, with X and all. I do not want a huge image, so I stripped it down to a 200 MB image with only dhcp and ssh and a few basic tools. It uses about 15 MB of RAM. This image allows you to start with almost nothing and build up only what you need.</p><a href="articles/Olimex_A20-OLinuXino-LIME2_minimal_debian_7_image.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="software/OpenVZ_Proxmox_-_pre-backup_all_container_dump_script.html">OpenVZ/Proxmox - pre-backup all container dump script</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">18-01-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>This simple script creates a vzdump of all the OpenVZ containers on a machine.

Most of them don't offer filtering capabilites like Sieve, or only their own non exportable rule system (Google Apps). My mail client of choice, Thunderbird, has filtering capabilities but my phone has not and I don't want to leave my machine running Thunderbird all the time since it gets quite slow with huge mailboxes. Imapfilter is a mail filtering utility written in Lua which connects to one or more IMAP accounts and filters on the server using IMAP queries. It is a lightweight command line utility, the configuration can be versioned and is simple text and it is very fast.</p><a href="blog/Filtering_IMAP_mail_with_imapfilter.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="blog/Broken_Corrupted_Raspberry_Pi_SD_Card.html">Broken Corrupted Raspberry Pi SD Card</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">09-01-2015 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>One of my Raspberry Pi's would not boot up after a reboot. The SD card was corrupted, sadly beyond repair. This article walks you through the steps I took to try to fix the SD card, including fsck, badblocks and other filesystem utilities.

Only ssh, not gitolite or any other software. This is usefull if you have a small team of people that don't often need access to the repo and don't want something like github or bitbucket.

Since they have no IPv6 (yet) I figured the simplest way was to block access to the entire IP range. This won't work for all the CDN networks they use, but it does get you started.

Normally the web interface is only accessible from the management LAN (or LAN by default) interface. If you for whatever reason locked yourself out or need access from a different IP via the WAN interface you can use the easyrule command line to temporarly add a rule that allows your remote IP in.

It has a detailed explanation with every step. We choose the IPSECP protocol stack because of recent vulnerabilities found in pptpd VPNs and because it is supported on all recent operating systems by default. More than ever, your freedom and privacy when online is under threat. Governments and ISPs want to control what you can and can't see while keeping a record of everything you do, and even the shady-looking guy lurking around your coffee shop or the airport gate can grab your bank details easier than you may think. A self hosted VPN lets you surf the web the way it was intended: anonymously and without oversight.</p><a href="tutorials/IPSEC_vpn_with_CentOS_7.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning_Extension_HPKP.html">HTTP Public Key Pinning Extension HPKP for Apache, NGINX and Lighttpd</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">30-12-2014 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>Public Key Pinning means that a certificate chain must include a whitelisted public key.

We do this by disabling SSL Compression to mitigate the CRIME attack, disable SSLv3 and below because of vulnerabilities in the protocol and we will set up a strong ciphersuite that enables Forward Secrecy when possible. We also set up HSTS and HPKP.
