As we all know, nobody uses emacs. No, all joking aside, I found it to be a good article and wanted to see how I could do that with Vim. Not in User Mode Linux, but by creating an actual ISO. Boot to Vim, as you might want to call it. This is actually fairly simple. Compile vim statically, set it as init= at boot and you're done. We are going to use small 9MB distro named Tiny Core, Core edition and customize that to boot right into our static build of Vim.</p><a href="blog/Vim_as_PID_1_Boot_to_Vim.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="blog/Statically_cross_compiled_vim_for_x86_x86-64_and_mips.html">Statically (cross) compiled vim for x86, x86-64 and mipsel</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">17-09-2014 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>Sometimes I need to manage a few systems with either low resources or a very restricted set of packages. On those systems no compilers or development libraries are available, however it is allowed to bring binaries.A few of those systems are 32 bit x68 systems, some are MIPS systems, even worse. They serve a secure purpose, I cannot go in to much detail about them, except for they require a high level of security, they process certificates. I really like vim as my editor, the only editor available by default on those systems is ed. I have an ed cheatsheet for this purpose. The solution for this problem is to create a statically (cross) compiled version of vim. This article shows you how to create a statically compiled vim that runs everywhere.</p><a href="blog/Statically_cross_compiled_vim_for_x86_x86-64_and_mips.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="blog/Owncloud_DirectAdmin,_Apache_2.4_and_Error_AH01797_client_denied_by_server_configuration.html">Owncloud, DirectAdmin, Apache 2.4 and Error AH01797: client denied by server configuration</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">15-09-2014 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>I keep a few servers around for shared webhosting for friends, family and some other domains. Most of them run Directadmin, because it is easier to work with for the target audience. I'm very good with the command line, they've never heard of it. One of my friends runs Owncloud, a wonderfull piece of software to get cloud services under your control. He does not use the file part but rather the calendar and contacts a lot. A recent update of Apache to 2.4.10 broke that functionality on a Directadmin machine with the error AH01797: client denied by server configuration. After a bit of searching and debugging, here's how I fixed it.</p><a href="blog/Owncloud_DirectAdmin,_Apache_2.4_and_Error_AH01797_client_denied_by_server_configuration.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="software/foaas.sh_-_Command_Line_FOAAS_Client.html">foaas.sh - Command Line Fuck Off as a Service client</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">08-09-2014 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>foaas.sh is a command line [Fuck Off as a Service client](http://foaas.com/).

We do this by disabling SSL Compression to mitigate the CRIME attack, disable SSLv3 and below because of vulnerabilities in the protocol and we will set up a strong ciphersuite that enables Forward Secrecy when possible.

A Time Capsule is a network attached storage device from Apple for use with their Time Machine. Time Machine gives users a very easy and userfriendly way to automatically create and restore (encrypted) backups. A Time Capsule is basically an expensive NAS that only talks the AFP/netatalk protocol. The 2 TB version costs $299 at this time, a Raspberry Pi only $35.</p><a href="articles/Build_a_35_dollar_Time_Capsule_-_Raspberry_Pi_Time_Machine.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="tutorials/Nagios_Core_4_Installation_on_Ubuntu_12.04.html">Nagios 4 + Nagiosgraph installation on Ubuntu</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">15-08-2014 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>This is a guide on installing the latest Nagios Core (4.0.8) on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04. Nagios is an open source computer system monitoring, network monitoring and infrastructure monitoring software application. Nagios offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications, and services. It alerts the users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when the problem has been resolved. The version in the Ubuntu 12.04 repositories is quite old, it is still the in the 3 branch. This guide helps to fix that by using the latest Nagios version. We also install Nagiosgraph, a plugin for Nagios which gives you graps of the metrics.</p><a href="tutorials/Nagios_Core_4_Installation_on_Ubuntu_12.04.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="articles/Building_HA_Clusters_With_Ansible_and_Openstack.html">Building HA Clusters with Ansible and Openstack</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">25-07-2014 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>This is an extensive guide on building high available clusters with Ansible and Openstack. We'll build a Highly available cluster consisting out of two load balancers, two database servers and two application servers running a simple wordpress site. This is all done with Ansible, the cluster nodes are all on Openstack.

We will configure an extra interface bridge and make sure VM traffic is NATed. I have a few dedicated servers, some run Proxmox. Most of them however have only a few IP's. Therefore the VM's in proxmox cannot all have a public IP. For most of them that is not a problem. If needed I run a proxy or set up iptables to forward ports to the VM's.</p><a href="tutorials/Proxmox_VE_One_Public_IP.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="snippets/CentOS_5_CA_Certificate_Bundle_Update.html">CentOS 5 CA Certificate Bundle Update</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">06-07-2014 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>This simple snippet shows you how to update the root ca certificate bundle on CentOS 5.

Keepalived is a piece of software which can be used to achieve high availability by assigning two or more nodes a virtual IP and monitoring those nodes, failing over when one goes down.

This tutorial covers the installation of the OSSEC 2.8 server, the standard OSSEC Web UI and the Analogi dashboard on Ubuntu 14.04. It also covers OSSEC setup with MySQL support.

Openstack Swift has a beautiful API which you can program to. However, sometimes it is handy to quickly be able to access your Swift/Objectstore data without programming around it. We will use ftp-cloudfs to do this. There is also Softlayers swftp, but that does not support Keystone Authentication (2.0). ftp-cloudfs does support this. The OS X Cyberduck FTP client also has Openstack Swift support, however that is a native implementation, not using FTP.

It provides encrypted backups using gpg so that you can safely use any public cloud storage to store them. This tutorial is for Ubuntu and CentOS and includes initial setup plus a script to automate it all. We will be using the Dutch provider CloudVPS, which is a non american company, so your data is more safe than it is with a provider that is vulnerable to the patriot act. Although your data is already encrypted with GPG, you can never be to sure. CloudVPS provides 10GB free ObjectStore, if you have VPS with them, the data is stored on at least 3 machines in 3 locations and they have a boatload of certifications.</p><a href="tutorials/Encrypted_Duplicity_Backups_to_Openstack_Swift_Objectstore.html">Read more...</a><br/><p></p><h4 class="blogh3"><a href="blog/IPv6_at_Home.html">IPv6 at Home</a></h4><small class="pull-left blogsmall">03-05-2014 | Remy van Elst</small><br/><p>One of my Raspberry Pi's was running a test setup of the Citadel groupware service.
