                <title>Use the Nitrokey HSM or SmartCard-HSM with mod_nss and Apache</title>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Nitrokey_HSM_in_Apache_with_mod_nss.html</guid>
                <description>This is a guide on using the Nitrokey HSM with mod_nss and the Apache webserver. The HSM allows you to store the private key for a SSL certificate inside the HSM (instead of on the filesystem), so that it can never leave the device and thus never be stolen. The guide covers the installation and configuration of mod_nss, coupling the HSM to NSS, generating the keys and configuring Apache, and last but not least we also do some benchmarks on Apache with the HSM and different key sizes.</description>

                <description>This is a guide to get started with the NitroKey HSM (or SmartCard-HSM). It covers what a HSM is and what it can be used for. It also goes over software installation and initializing the device, including backups of the device and the keys. Finally we do some actual crypto operatons via pkcs11, OpenSSL, Apache and OpenSSH.</description>
