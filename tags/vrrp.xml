                <description>Keepalived supports running scripts on VRRP state change. This can come in handy when you need to execute an action when a failover occurs. In my case, I have a VPN running on a Virtual IP and want to make sure the VPN only runs on the node with the Virtual IP.</description>

                <description>We are going to set up very simple keepalived IP failover on Ubuntu 14.04. Keepalived is a piece of software which can be used to achieve high availability by assigning two or more nodes a virtual IP and monitoring those nodes, failing over when one goes down.  Keepalived can do more, like load balancing and monitoring, but this tutorial focusses on a very simple setup, just IP failover.</description>
