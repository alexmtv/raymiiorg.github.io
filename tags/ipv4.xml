                <title>Traceroute IPv6 to Smokeping Target config</title>

                <description>This little one-liner converts the output of traceroute for IPv6 to Smokeping Target output. I had only setup my smokepings for IPv4. Recently we had an issue were network config was borked and the whole IPv4 network was not announced via BGP anymore. I was at home troubleshooting, but finding nothing since I have native IPv6 and that part still worked. My Smokeping did show loss, and that explicitly uses IPv4. That helped with the debugging a lot. I have a [IPv4][4] version of this article as well.</description>

                <title>IPv4 Address Conversion Tricks</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/articles/IPv4_Address_Conversion_Tricks.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/articles/IPv4_Address_Conversion_Tricks.html</guid>
                <description>Did you know that http://3515693643/ is a valid link? Why? Because this is the decimal form of the binary IP address. Normally we represent IP addresses as 10.0.0.1, 4 blocks of numbers. Those numbers are actually binary octets represented in decimal, therefore they can never be more than 255. If we take the whole binary number of all blocks, and convert that to base 10, we get a result like above, which in turn is a working network address. I've written a little javascript based converter so you can try it out yourself.</description>
