                <title>Nitrokey gnuk firmware update via DFU</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Nitrokey_gnuk_firmware_update_via_DFU.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Nitrokey_gnuk_firmware_update_via_DFU.html</guid>
                <description>The Nitrokey (start, all of them) can be upgraded to a newer GNUK firmware. However, this can only be done via ST Link or DFU, if you use the Gnuk USB firmware upgrade you will brick the device. This guide shows you how to attach a DFU adapter and how to flash firmware to a Nitrokey, both for upgrading or unbricking an USB upgraded one.</description>

                <description>The FST-01 (Flying Stone 1) is a small STM32F103TB based USB device designed to run gnuk and NeuG (gpg usb token or true random number generator). This guide shows you how to upgrade the firmware on the FST-01 so that you can enjoy newer gnuk features like 4096 bit RSA keys.</description>

                <title>Nitrokey Start: Getting started guide (gnuk openpgp token)</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Nitrokey_Start_Getting_started_guide.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Nitrokey_Start_Getting_started_guide.html</guid>
                <description>The Nitrokey Start is an OpenPGP USB token. It supports three 2048 bit GPG keys and is based on gnuk. Gnuk is an implementation of USB cryptographic token for GPG. Cryptographic token is a store of private keys and it computes cryptographic functions on the device. The main difference with other GPG cards like the Nitrokey Pro or the OpenPGP card is that this device does not use a smartcard. Whereas the other devices are basically USB smartcard readers, the Nitrokey Start has everything in it's firmware. This article is a getting started guide where I talk about the initial setup of the device, setting up a user PIN, an admin PIN and a reset code, generating the key and subkeys on the device, or loading external keys into the device and usage examples with GPG, OpenSSH and Thunderbird.</description>

                <title>Encrypted Duplicity Backups to Openstack Swift Objectstore</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Encrypted_Duplicity_Backups_to_Openstack_Swift_Objectstore.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Encrypted_Duplicity_Backups_to_Openstack_Swift_Objectstore.html</guid>
                <description>This is a guide on backing up your data to an Openstack Swift (Objectstore) instance using Duplicity. It provides encrypted backups using gpg so that you can safely use any public cloud storage to store them. This tutorial is for Ubuntu and CentOS and includes initial setup plus a script to automate it all. We will be using the Dutch provider CloudVPS, which is a non american company, so your data is more safe than it is with a provider that is vulnerable to the patriot act. Although your data is already encrypted with GPG, you can never be to sure. CloudVPS provides 10GB free ObjectStore, if you have VPS with them, the data is stored on at least 3 machines in 3 locations and they have a boatload of certifications.</description>
